Abstract
Over 2 billion people worldwide are unbanked, underbanked or cannot easily access modern financial services, compounding issues such as poverty, food security and access to education. This is not only a problem for these individuals, but also for financial institutions who cannot easily deduce who is trustworthy as identity, collateral and financial history is informal or semi-informal. 
Establishment of Village Banks or Village Lending and Savings Associations have been highly touted across the world as a solution to deepening access to financial services for the un and underbanked. These solutions are not only highly impactful, but are established and maintained via internal community capital and resources. In 2016, CGAP reported that over 110 organizations supported these systems and over 1.5 billion people used them.
By integrating existing distributed and unconnected savings and lending communities, to public distributed  ledger systems, more flexible, affordable, accessible and open financial products can be developed specifically to meet the needs that these systems currently cannot provide. 
Working directly with savings and lending communities,  web3 communities and other ecosystem stakeholders, a network will be established for new financial primitives specific to un/underbanked savings and lending protocols.
Together with communities, NGOs, the private sector and the web3 and Cardano communities, existing savings and lending networks will establish sustainable, responsible, bottom-up opportunities for themselves by leveraging new and more efficient financial tools.
What is a Village Bank (VB) or Village Lending and Savings Association (VSLA)?
Generally a group is formed by members of a community who are unable to access traditional forms of capital for varying reasons such as identity, collateral or proven track record. Members of this group come together and regularly save money so that it may be lent to other members needing access to capital. 
Once loaned and used for its purpose, repayment occurs with interest and this repayment capital plus the interest is then re-lent circularly within the group. 
This allows for a regular and compounding source of pooled capital to be lent, increase the group’s total capital, fund local MSMEs, and proportionally share the benefits. These systems are generally time based and at the end of each cycle the total savings plus interest earned is shared out proportionally amongst members of the group based on their total individual savings.

VBs and VSLAs are essentially self-sovereign micro-banks that are community run, driven, operated and owned. 
Imagine the possibilities of a self driven and integrated web3 system that increases the opportunities for un/underbanked populations and contributes to a self-sovereign economic identity.

Enhancing Systems with Web3 and Transparent Ledgers
There are many ways to enhance the viability, value and impact of these groups by integrating with existing systems that track savings and lending data.
The first aim of S₳VE is to establish a system to verify and validate existing data so that high quality, but under financed individuals and/or groups have ownership of their self created identities and can digitally showcase their successes to web3 and other financiers. The second aim of S₳VE is to connect these individuals and groups with complimentary financial products that inherit the values and ethos of VB and VSLA protocols. 
Proof of Concept 
 
As a proof of concept, S₳VE aims to work with VBs/VSLAs through the use of NFT Savings Boosts. These NFTs will allow buyers to support VBs/VSLAs by starting group or individual balances with a positive saving balance and receive the role of ‘Digital Saver’ within the VB/VSLA. The ‘Digital Saver’ will be limited to saving and receive their proportional individual savings to total group capital at the end of the cycle. These NFTs will allow for a slow and methodical integration of web3 tools, education and learnings to best understand how to design a larger and more impactful protocol and token. 

During this stage, S₳VE team and network will continually evaluate existing systems, dialogue with VBs/VSLAs, establish robust industry partnerships and engage all stakeholders to understand what is the best path forward to establish a variety of bottom of the pyramid savings and lendings mechanisms and products.
An ‘Impact Network’ Approach
Many people say, “Your network is your net worth” and this fully rings true when it comes to VBs, VSLAs and web3 protocols, because in the end, all they are are networks and create real world value. With the core belief of networks and meeting people where they are, S₳VE intends to build a community of supporters from Cardano, the web3 community at large and more traditional organizations or stakeholders.
Much of the work to establish, enhance and generate opportunities for these groups has been done by international NGOs and other organizations, such as CARE International, Catholic Relief Services, SEEP Network, CGAP, VSLA Associates, SAVIX and many others. These organizations have not only been successful, but continue to innovate and explore ways in which these systems can be leveraged. 
By continuing to grow personal and professional networks, S₳VE will be able to put the purpose at the center and our networks at the edge, so that we may create robust tools, systems and rules to enhance opportunities for successful savers and borrowers.

The Impacts of Enhancement
The un/underbanked populations of the world are generally women in low income countries and/or communities. By potentially not including the populations of half of the world’s Low/Middle Income Countries in banking, resources are un/underutilized and opportunities for inclusion reduced.
According to Care International’s 2023 report on savings and lending groups (‘Beyond the Box’), over 70% of the members of the 17m VB and VSLA members are women. Their data also shows that for every $1 saved, $9.35 is generated. The members of these groups are also 85% more likely to have an emergency fund, 50%-60% less likely to experience food insecurity, 54% are more likely to own assets and 37% can sell those assets without others permission. 
These groups and the work being done in this sector shows that by women being in control of their resources, their values and priorities can be compounded within their families and communities, creating a sustainable value and community driven future to finance.

 
The Future of S₳VE 
S₳VE is currently a concamazing possibilities that can be imagined in web3.ept. It is not an organization, it is not a business, it is not a protocol. First it should become a viable network, even if small, of connection. From there, it will find where it goes and what becomes of it. But, in the future there are some 

Federated Lending: Federated lending pools can allow capital to flow between groups, decreasing the geographical mismatch of lending supply and demand. As this grows, a new type of bottom up banking system could emerge.

Staking as Collateral: Holders of a S₳VE token (or other acceptable tokens) and savers alike could stake assets to a specific VB or VSLA to use as collateral against default of group or individual loans that have originated externally to increase the loans available to the group or network as a whole.

Impact Lending: By verifying financial identity created via community and group transactions, the ‘internal’ can face ‘external’ and allow for expansion of financial products to meet longer term needs that VBs or VSLAs cannot currently support.

New Forms of Capital and new mechanisms: Financial capital is only one of the 8 forms of capital, but through the use of tokens, new forms of capital can be valued and more liquid. Tokens backed by carbon sequestration or avoidance are one example of new capital, while quadratic voting for capital allocation is a mechanism currently being used in the web3 and blockchain space to fund public goods.

Saver Owned Governance
S₳VE intends to eventually become an openly governed system that allows for users and holders of S₳VE assets, to contribute to improving and enhancing this network. This will allow for deeper decentralization and decision making from the people, organizations and communities who use and benefit from S₳VE. This follows directly the ethos that established VBs and VSLAs from their inception. Groups already use base sets of rules and guidelines to self establish and govern themselves. By eventually bringing these systems on-chain, users will continue to be able to continue in their capacity of self-governance.
S₳VE as a PartnerChain
VBs and VSLAs often exist in bubbles, as that is their strength. During the establishment of systems, users should be protected from the dangers of web3, as they do exist, by using the partnerchain model to create an on-chain bubble. This bubble will allow for a safe environment dedicated to impact lending and borrowing and tailored financial products.The Cardano Ecosystem is a big world and reducing opportunities for loss of funds will always be a priority.
To ensure security, stability and privacy within the S₳VE system, a partnerchain to the Cardano public ledger is intended to be established. This chain will inherit the high security of the Cardano mainchain, but also allow for changes so that S₳VE is affordable, useable and trusted. 
By using a sidechain, use of the system can be gated to ensure mechanisms and products intended to be used by VBs, VSLAs and their members are not abused by external actors that can interrupt the successes of these cycles and the network.

Kyle enjoys conceptualizing, planning and shaping impact and bottom up systems that flip traditional systems over. Kyle is an active Cardano user, community member, entrepreneur and joined the community because of the future promise of Real-Fi. 
Well guess what? (the future is now!) RealFi is here! The tools and systems to start creating new economic identities and building blocks exists now and will only improve.If we are to solve the most pressing issues of our time, be it climate change or economic inequality, we must change our systems. The status quo got us into this mess, it cannot get us out. The rails of web3 can help us create more fair and free people, societies, systems and lives for many who are currency excluded or under-included. 
Kyle has a Bachelors in Finance from the University of Nebraska in the United States, was a Peace Corps Volunteer from 2014-2016 and co-founded Nature’s Nectar a sustainable honey company in Zambia focused on environmental value and preservation. He intends to also enhance the work of Nature’s Nectar through web3 systems and the VT-TV approach. He enjoys going to national parks, punk music, photography, birding, reading and learning.
Life over the last 10 years in Zambia has shaped him to always put impact first, because if we are to change our systems, we must start where the most positive impact can be made and better systems built.

Inspiring S₳VE  and Learning Resources
The idea of S₳VE has been inspired by many individuals and organizations that are driving real impact across the world through bottom up and fair web3 or transparent systems. Thank you all for the work you do! It helps others learn, grow and think about how these systems can be used to create value based systems for all!

/All headings are linked to more information!/

ETHIC HUB
	EthicHub is a blockchain protocol built on the Ethereum and Celo networks. It exists solely to meet financing gaps in supply chains. Based in Mexico, the team has developed a unique model of overcollateralization via ETHIX tokens that are used as collateral for trade and working capital financing. 
The inspiration for S₳VE is to eventually base the treasury for the S₳VE ecosystem on the success of the ETHIX model. Currently, ETHIX is collateralized by over $10m USD in tokens, with outstanding loans being overcollateralized by more than 5x. 
GRASSROOTS ECONOMICS
Grassroots Economics is a non-profit based in Kenya that works with communities to develop and deploy various forms of Community Inclusion Currencies. These ‘currencies’ function as a form of localized collateral within communities and can be used as a medium of exchange based on local and community resources. 
The system S₳VE intends to launch is very similar to the systems Grassroots Economics uses, but also differs in how capital is created, allocated and injected. In the future, the systems may grow closer or further away from one another, but that is only for the protocols and people to decide. 
BLOOM NETWORK
Bloom Network is a network of communities and individuals who connect to take climate action where they are through regenerative economics principles. Bloom is also integrating web3 tools and principles into their work. Maybe one day the Bloom Network and the S₳VE Networks can become connected so that learnings between systems can be shared. 
STARCHCHAIN
StarchChain is one of the first partnerchains/sidechains on Cardano. It is unique in that it uses a proof of attendance consensus mechanism to produce the $STRCH tokens. To mine the STRCH token, attendance is taken and rewarded. S₳VE intends to adapt this model to one day use attendance as a parameter within the consensus mechanism. 
This project, be it about potatoes and memes, has egalitarian roots and systems that showcase the possibilities of what a dedicated sidechain ecosystem can accomplish. As STRCH continues to grow, it will continue to inspire S₳VE and build new systems that will benefit the Real World Communities.
Scott Poynton - ‘Beyond Certification’ 
Scott Poynton is an entrepreneur and a 30+ year expert in forestry certifications and verifications. In May of 2015, Scott published ‘Beyond Certification,’ a book about the certification industry and why a well intentioned industry lost its way. In this book he proposed a new approach that can be enhanced via blockchain and web3 systems called VT-TV.
VT-TV stands for Values, Transparency, Transformation and Verification and  S₳VE intends to use this approach as much as possible. What is created and valued internally, much be faced externally and evaluated. Then and only then will we be able to reduce barriers that certifications and standardizations have put in place.
Impact Networks by David Ehrlichman 
	This book outlines how to be successful in developing, organizing and growing impact networks that grow where they need to. It lays out how to work within a network towards a common purpose, not towards the maximum of the individuals organization or person you represent or are. It lets a common goal drive the process by a variety of stakeholders, experts and communities.
